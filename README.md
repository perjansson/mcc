Meeting Cost Calculator
===

Frontend for Meeting cost calculator, implemented in Angular.js, jQuery, Bootstrap etc. 

I'm building Meeting cost calculator mostly to try out and learn different frameworks, techniques and patterns. But also little bit because I think quite a lot of meetings are a waste of time. Some of them are good, some of them are necessary, but some of them are just a waste of time and money.

Backend for Meeting cost calculator (built with Node.js) can be found <a href="https://github.com/perjansson/mcc_backend_nodejs">here</a>.
